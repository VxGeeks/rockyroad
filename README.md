Rocky Road Project Files

This is the base repository for our "Rocky Road" PCB design files and example code.  A more complete description of the design intents and operation can be found in the [Tinker](http://www.vxdisplays.com) section of our website.

The PCB design was created in Kicad 4.0.
The Code is a QT Creator project with a handy GUI for creating graphics tables, etc.  The driver code is taken from the examples posted in our [Design Packages](http://www.vxdisplays.com/pmoled), with minimal changes to link to common Raspberry Pi APIs.
